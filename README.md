Partial Modification Loader(PML) is a mod/plugin system designed for generic Java application interfacing, utilizing elements of Aspect Oriented Program. (Uses Oracle Java 7 - Dalvik not supported)


This is the Pre-Agent code for PML - this portion of the code deals with loading OS-specific code in order to add support for re-transformation of classes under the Instrumentation API for standard jre installs. (OS-specific code is from Oracle's OS-specific jdk downloads for Java 7. Oracle coded and owns these files, not me.)
